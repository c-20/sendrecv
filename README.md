# sendrecv
send and recv coordinate data

send program will create an applet to upload one packet per five geolocation samples. It will also open recv.

recv program will create a page that renders colour (ANSI) text of the stored data from send organised into folders (jia) and days (ri).

Requires HTTPS in many browsers unless coordinates are externally sourced

Next step: externally sourced coordinates + mouse hijack

Todo: Update send to update in real-time + have recv check server for changes
